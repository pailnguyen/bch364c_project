Place the folder containing the images in the `jkl` folder along with `localisations-endogenous.txt`. To train the network, run `batch_resize.py` first, then run `generate_image_bytes.py`. Lastly, run `jkl_train.py` to train the network and `jkl_eval.py` to evaluate the performance of the network as training progresses.
