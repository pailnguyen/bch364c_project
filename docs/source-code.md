To download the source code for our CNN, visit [https://github.com/pailnguyen/bch364c_project](https://github.com/pailnguyen/bch364c_project) and follow the directions in the `README`.

The image dataset that our network was trained on can be found at [http://locate.imb.uq.edu.au/downloads.shtml](http://locate.imb.uq.edu.au/downloads.shtml). We only used the "Endogenous" images.
